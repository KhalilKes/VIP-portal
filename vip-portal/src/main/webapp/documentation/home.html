        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>
            The Virtual Imaging Platform (VIP) project targets multi-modality, 
            multi-organ and dynamic (4D) medical image simulation. Integrating 
            proven simulation software of the four main imaging modalities 
            (MRI, US, PET and CT), the platform will cope with interoperability 
            challenges among simulators, will address compatibility issues 
            between organ models and will provide transparent access to 
            computing and storage resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            To tackle interoperability issues, the semantics of models and 
            simulation tools will be made explicit. Thiswill be achieved using 
            annotations referring to a set of consistent ontologies describing 
            the organ models, the simulation data processing, the simulation 
            tools and the simulated images. Associated repositories and software 
            interfaces will allow easy experiment design and assisted simulator 
            and model integration. To address the computational challenge, grid 
            technology will be employed. Yet, to cope with reliability issues 
            of large-scale grid systems, VIP proposes to develop a multi-
            infrastructure execution environment able to use both local 
            computing resources (multi-core servers and clusters) and large-
            scale grids. No heavy code parallelization is involved though: 
            speed-up will be provided from data and code parallelism only, 
            naturally expressed in simulations.
        </p>

            VIP includes a strong application aspect to guarantee the adequacy 
            of the resulting environment with the needs of imaging techniques 
            developers, model designers and image processing researchers. 
            Specifically, VIP includes 4 applicative objectives that will be 
            used to demonstrate this adequacy. These applications are the 
            following: the validation SINDBAD CT simulator (1), the development 
            of a new US sequence for motion detection (2), the modelling of 
            inflammation process from MRI simulation (3) and the evaluation of 
            cardiac segmentation algorithms from multi-modality images (4).
